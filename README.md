# Learning Jenkins

For an assigment I need to get familiar with Jenkins as a CI-tool. Before this I've mostly used Github Actions and Gitlab CI/CD. The pipeline should suit a microservice designpattern, the apps running are mostly Java Spring boot based and built using Gradle. Unittesting with JUnit is central. Sonarqube is also used in the pipeline.

My learning style is centered on trying to understand "the big picture" and then working on applying this knowledge on the nitty gritty. I have some go to resources where I often start my DevOps learning. One of my main googling-patterns is trying to find info about a tool I'm somewhat aquainted with and putting it versus the tool I'm learning. I'm going to document my learning and the sources I found useful, if some seem a little strange it might be because of this kind of "versus-learning".

Along the way I'm getting reaquainted with IntelliJ, as I've been using VS Code for most projects after learning the basics of Java at the beginning of my studies. I'm also challenging myself to use git in the commandline.
